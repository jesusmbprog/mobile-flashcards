## Mobile Flashcards App

This project is a "Mobile Flashcards" game created for Udacity's React nano-degree. To learn how to develop React-native.

The game consists a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
